8.0.15,Reset,RW,0=normal; 1=reset;,"Asserting this register bit has the same effect as a pin power-on-reset (except it does not reset the MDIO controller or registers).  On de-assertion of this bit device operation will follow the normal power-on-reset sequence dependant on the state of 8.0.15 (MMD8 reset bit), 30.0.11 & 30.0.9 (the Rx and Tx datapath reset request bits), and 30.0.15 (manual reset select bit).  These bits are not affected by assertion of this bit and will retain their previous state.

Setting this bit will forcibly set the Reset bit (8.0.15).  To exit the low power state this bit should be cleared, followed by the Reset bit (8.0.15) using separate MDIO writes to provide adequate delay.
