R30.3840,eFuse Control,16'h2000,,
30.3840.15,program,RW,,"Toggling this bit from a zero to a one state causes the eFuse register bit addressed by 30.3840.9:0 to be programmed to a one value. During programming 'done' (30.3840.13) will be de-asserted. Programming will not occur if the efuse is in its power-down state (30.3841.15=0), or if 'done' (30.3840.13) is not asserted."
30.3840.14,fetch,RW,,"Toggling this bit from a zero to a one state causes the eFuse contents to be fetched and loaded into registers 30.1408 to 30.1420. Fetching will not occur if the efuse is in its power-down state (30.3841.15=0), or if 'done' (30.3840.13) is not asserted. Registers 30.1409 to 30.1440 will not be fetched if the content of the eFuse byte 0 (30.1408) is zero - ie if the eFuse has not been programmed."
30.3840.13,done,R,,eFuse actions complete. 0=eFuse program or fetch operations are in progress.
30.3840.12,read,RW,,"Toggling this bit from a zero to a one state causes the eFuse 16bit word addressed by 30.3840.7:1 to be read and loaded into register 30.3842. Reading will not occur if the efuse is in its power-down state (30.3841.15=0), or if 'done' (30.3840.13) is not asserted."
30.3840.11,Reserved,R,,
30.3840.10:8, bit address,RW,,This field indicates which eFuse bit (of a byte) to set to a one in a program operation.
30.3840.7:0,byte address,RW,,This field indicates which eFuse byte to program in a program operation.
,,,,
R30.3841,eFuse Power-up,16'h0000,,
30.3841.15,Power-up,RW,0=powerdn;1=power up,This bit controls the power state of the eFuse arrays after reset : 0 (default) = arrays are powered down; 1 = arrays are powered up; This bit must be set to a one in order to program or fetch the contents of the eFuse arrays.

R30.3842,efuse read value,16'h0000,,
30.3842.15:0,read value,RW,, This register contains the 16bit data value read from the eFuse by a “Read” command.
