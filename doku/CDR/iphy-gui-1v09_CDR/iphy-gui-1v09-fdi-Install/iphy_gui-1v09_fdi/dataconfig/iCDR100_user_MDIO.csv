30.0.15,Manual Reset select,RW,0 = Hardware Sequencing; 1= Manual sequencing; ,"1= Manual Reset sequencing; 0 = Hardware Reset Sequencing (default). Pin reset RESETN leaves the gearbox device in a fully reset state.  Bringing the device into an operational state requires sequencing of SERDES reset signals.  Two sequencing methods are supported: Manual, and hardware sequenced.  This bit selects which method controls internal reset signals.  When Manual control is selected fields in register 30.44 control internal reset signals, otherwise bits in this register control them."
30.0.14:10,Reserved,R,,
30.0.9,Software Reset ,RW,,"This bit controls datapath reset signals, if hardware reset sequencing is selected (30.0.15=0). Asserting this bit resets the datapath of the device  De-asserting this bit causes a sequenced removal of reset from the  datapath using the hardware reset sequencer.  This bit is set to a zero by assertion of the RESETN pin."
30.0.8,Reset seq done,R,,"1=Tx Datapath Reset Sequencer Inactive.  This bit is de-asserted whilst the Tx hardware reset sequencer is in operation.  This bit is asserted when the hardware reset sequencer finishes operations, or is inactive."
30.0.7,MDIO init,RW,,"Writing a 1 to this bit locations sets all MDIO registers except register 30.0 (this register) to their default states.  This bit is write only, and is always read as a 0."
30.0.6,Reserved,R,,
30.0.5,Hard Reset,RW,0=unreset; 1=reset,"Asserting  this register bit has the same effect as a pin power-on-reset (except it does not reset the MDIO controller or registers). On de-assertion of this bit device operation will follow the normal Power-on-reset sequence dependant on the state of 30.0.10 (the Software reset request bit), and 30.0.15 (manual reset select bit). These bits are not affected by assertion of this bit and will retain their previous state. Note that, as in a normal power-on-reset sequence, the eFuse trim bits will be fetched from the eFuse array on de-assertion of hard reset."
30.0.4,Low Power,RW,0=normal; 1=low power,Setting this bit places the device into an ultra-low power state. All non-MDIO digital circuitry is reset and all analog circuitry placed into its IDDQ state. Asserting this bit has the same effect as asserting the following MMD30 bits : 30.44.4:2. Setting this bit will forcibly set the Hard Reset bit (30.0.5).
