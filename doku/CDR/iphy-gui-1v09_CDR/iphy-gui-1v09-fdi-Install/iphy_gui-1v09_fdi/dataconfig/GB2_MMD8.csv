8.0.15,Reset,RW,0=normal; 1=reset;,"Asserting this register bit has the same effect as a pin power-on-reset (except it does not reset the MDIO controller or registers).  On de-assertion of this bit device operation will follow the normal power-on-reset sequence dependant on the state of 8.0.15 (MMD8 reset bit), 30.0.11 & 30.0.9 (the Rx and Tx datapath reset request bits), and 30.0.15 (manual reset select bit).  These bits are not affected by assertion of this bit and will retain their previous state.  Note that, as in a normal power-on-reset sequence, the eFuse trim bits will be fetched from the eFuse array on de-assertion of reset",,,

8.0.12,Reserved,R,,,,,
8.0.11,Low Power,RW,," Setting this bit places the device into an ultra-low power state.  All non-MDIO digital circuitry is reset and all analog circuitry placed into its IDDQ state. Asserting this bit has the same effect as asserting the following MMD30 bits: 8.0.15, 30.44.4:2, 30.1537.15,  30.1537.9:0, 30.1538.9:0, and de-asserting 30.1281.15.  Setting this bit will forcibly set the Reset bit (8.0.15).  To exit the low power state this bit should be cleared, followed by the Reset bit (8.0.15) using separate MDIO writes to provide adequate delay.  See Note 1 (above) on the operation of the reset bit (8.0.15).",,,

8.0.1,PMA remote loopback,RW,0=disable; 1=enable,Enable PMA remote loopback mode. Remote Loopback mode sends 28G serial data received on a lane back out on the same lane using the Tx datapath. Transmitted data is a bit serial copy of received data.  ,,,
